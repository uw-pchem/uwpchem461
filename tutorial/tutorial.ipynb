This notebook is written to serve all students, whether you have extensive coding experience or none at all. The only items you will turn in for a grade are described in three \"checkpoints\" in the notebook.\n",

    "• If you have never coded in Python, no worries!

    "    In Python, users either write their own code or they can use code someone else has written. In CHEM461, we will use a lot of code from others. That code is stored in modules (or packages) that must be imported before you can use it. For example, the first command in the cell below (the gray box) below imports a module that is commonly used for plotting, and the second imports a module popular for manipulating numbers (especially arrays).  \n",
